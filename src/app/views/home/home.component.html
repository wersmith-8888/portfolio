    I'm a <b><i>Full Stack UX Designer</i></b> who prototypes and designs through the lens of behavioral econcomics and psychology to learn about the context, emotions, and ecosystems of users.
    <br /><br />
    To <i>uncover user needs and test hypotheses and assumptions</i>, some of my favorite research techniques are guerilla usability testing, card sorting, competitive reviews and usability testing, contextual inquiry, and ethnogrpahic research.
    <br /> <br />
    My process starts with <i>blue sky thinking and validation</i>. From there, I narrow my designs through usability testing and funnel ideas into easily implementable pieces. I live and breathe hand-drawn wireframing and storyboarding. I believe solutioning without sketching limits innovation.

    I have been blessed with the opportunity to work with colleagues spanning across many of the fortune 500  brands and industries. A handful of the amazing brands I worked with in the past are Wells Fargo, Merrill Lynch, The Home Depot, Nissan, Equifax, McKesson, AT&T, Marathon Petroleum, and Eli Lilly and Co.
    <br /> <br />
    Unfortunately a lot of my work for these brands is under NDS. If you want to learn more about my experience outside of my case studies, please contact me.
