    Sparks Grove was engaged to help our client redesign an in-store sales enablement tool for their store employees. Store em- ployees’ roles ranged from sales people who helped complete 100+ item orders, relationship professionals who made sure the orders were accurately and effectively filled, customer service representatives, and management who were solely responsible for the store’s key performance metrics.
    <br /><br />
    Store employees are continually bombarded with questions about products while trying to complete multiple orders at once and use a desktop computer with a touch screen monitor, frequently showing customer order details.

    Prior to this work, NextGear had not completed deep research on their user base to understand who uses the systems they provide to manage their short term car dealership loans. Originally, I conducted 9 phone interviews, where members of the product team joined the calls to hear more about the dealers and their daily process. 
    <br /> <br />
    Stemming from that small work, the product team was convinced to invest in and conduct a deep dive user study with the output being user personas. 
    <br /> <br />
    In the duration of this study, we interviewed 28 dealership owners and staff members across 4 cities which we used to develop 4 personas.

    The original apps that the NextGear team built had low internal user adoption. The UX team was tasked with delivering a Design System and UI library for our developer’s use. 
    <br /><br />
    When building the design system, I took inventory of design components across four production apps, understood the development team’s skillset / architecture and coupled that with industry leading Brad Frost’s Atomic Design System approach.
